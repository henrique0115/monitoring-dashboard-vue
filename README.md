# Motivation

* I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot", but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the close one is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and unmaintained. 
* Want to build a fancy UI.
* Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
* Show the power of Bootstrap 5. 
* Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of REST API.
* Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.
