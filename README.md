## Motivation

* I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot", but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the close ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and unmaintained.
* Want to build a fancy UI.
* Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
* Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
* Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of REST API.
* Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

## üó£Ô∏è Discussion

You can also discuss or ask for help in [Issues](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues).

Alternatively, you can discuss in my original post on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/oi7dc7/uptime_kuma_a_fancy_selfhosted_monitoring_tool_an/

I think the real "Discussion" tab is hard to use, as it is reddit-like flow, I always missed new comments.
