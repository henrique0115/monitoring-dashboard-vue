# How to translate

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a language file. (e.g. `zh-TW.js`) The filename must be ISO language code: http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm
3. `npm run update-language-files --base-lang=de-DE`
6. Your language file should be filled in. You can translate now.
7. Translate `src/pages/Settings.vue` (search for a `Confirm` component with `rel="confirmDisableAuth"`).
8. Import your language file in `src/main.js` and add it to `languageList` constant.
9. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pulls) when you have done.
