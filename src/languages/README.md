# How to translate

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a language file. (e.g. zh-TW.js) The filename must be ISO language code: http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm

3. `npm run update-language-file`
4. Your language file should be filled in. You can now translate now.
5. Make a pull request when you have done.

If you do not have programming skills, let me know in Issue section. I will assist you. 😏
